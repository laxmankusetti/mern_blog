          I have been doing web development for the past year and learned it the
          hard way in the initial days.I felt that it would be better if someone
          explained it to me. Now I am starting this blog to share what I have
          learned for those who are currently moving into web development.

        <p className="font-semibold">
          Here I will try to put the details and code of each project, so it
          will be easy for anyone who wants to see and compare things like
          typos.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold">
          Besides, projects with stacks of each technology ie HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, reactjs, reduxjs, expressjs, nodejs, mongodb, tailwind
          css, bootstrap css and many more are placed here. You can ask me
          doubts in the form of comments to my post, I will try to resolve them
          as soon as possible.
